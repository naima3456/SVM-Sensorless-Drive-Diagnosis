# <span style="color: yellow;">SVM Classification for Sensorless Drive Diagnosis</span>

Welcome to the SVM Classification project for Sensorless Drive Diagnosis. This repository features a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the application of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm on the "Sensorless Drive Diagnosis" dataset. SVM is employed for solving classification problems using real-world data related to drive diagnostics.

## What's Inside

In this repository, you'll find:

- A Jupyter Notebook providing a practical demonstration of SVM's utilization.
- <span style="background-color: #FFA500; color: white; padding: 2px 4px;">Evaluation of default SVM models with a focus on Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), along with execution time assessment.</span>
- <span style="background-color: #87CEEB; color: white; padding: 2px 4px;">Determination of optimal SVM parameters using a grid search algorithm.</span>
- Comparison of model performances based on MSE and RMSE metrics.
- Application of Lasso and Ridge penalization techniques, followed by a reevaluation of models while considering errors and execution times.
- <span style="background-color: #FFA500; color: white; padding: 2px 4px;">Exploration of strategies to enhance execution times, potentially leveraging techniques like SPARK.</span>
